AR1: Ruhe, Gunther, and Moshood Omolade Saliu. "The art and science of software release planning." IEEE Software 22.6 (2005): 47-53.
SUM1: Release planning is used to select and assign the feature in product releases, which need to satisfy the factor of technique, resource, budget, risk and so on, a good release planning need to provide the best business value of development, satisfy the most important stakeholders and should be feasible in recent resource and should show the dependency of different features. So it's very difficult to make a release plan. There are two way to make the release plan, art way or science way.
Art way means, that the release plan is based on human ability and experience, in Agile, RP pay attention to the next duration, but with the increase of stakeholders and constraints, it will become unsuitable.
Science way means, using modeling to solve the problem, we need consider about feature, dependencies between features, resource constraints, the importance of stakeholders, the prioritization of features and also the objective function when we are modeling.
Author come out with a new way that using science way to create several solution and let the human judge which solution is best by experience. There will be three steps of this solution: modeling, exploration and consolidation.
